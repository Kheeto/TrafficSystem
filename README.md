# TrafficSystem
A simple unity project that simulates road traffic using a waypoint navigation system.<br>
The cars stop at junctions depending if it's their turn or not, and try to avoid crashes.

They will just choose a random path to follow around the map, each waypoint can have multiple branches creating many different paths.
